# ServIS

ServIS is a web information system for companies working with excavators. 
The application should be able to show various company offers and enable users to inquire about them. 
The auction of the repaired excavators should also be part of the application.
The mentioned features should be available for both registered and unregistered users. However the registered users will have some advantages (e.g. pre-filled forms).
